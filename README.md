**The Exercise**

Using any image API of your choice, or API that returns content with images:
- Retrieve a list of at least 50 images and display them as thumbnails on a page
- Paginate thumbnails by 10 thumbnails per page
- When clicking on an image it should display in a modal.
- All images should be about a specific theme or based on a specific word

**Technical Constraints**
- The Application should be built with html/js/css
- You may use pre-processors for css (but no frameworks, such as bootstrap)
- You may use whatever build tools you want
- The application should work and run when executing `npm i && npm start` from its root directory
- Please code in vanilla JS (no frameworks, or libraries)
- Take responsive design into consideration
- Your application only needs to work in Chrome
- If applicable: Include instructions for running your unit tests
